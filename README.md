Sine wave being modulated by a sine wave. Can select a log ramp or another sine to alter the modulating sine function by toggling the 'Log Ramp / Sin LFO' button.
Now with selectable Triangle wave being modulated by a triangle wave. Can also select a log ramp or another sine to alter the modulating sine function by toggling the 'Log Ramp / Sin LFO' button.

Could not decide on tremelo or ring modulator so its sort of a highbred...for now, below the 0.5 slider trem amount setting its a tremelo, and above 0.5 its a ring modulator.
Theres other sliders for sliding too.
There is also a crappy white noise button. Don't bother clicking that one.
