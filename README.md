Sine wave being modulated by a sine wave. Can select a log ramp or another sine to multiply the modulating sine function.
Could not decide on tremelo or ring modulator so its sort of a highbred...for now.
Don't forget to turn the volume slider up before you hit Play. Theres other sliders for sliding too.
