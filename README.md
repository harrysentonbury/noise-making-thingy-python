Sine wave being modulated by a sine wave. Can select a log ramp or another sine to multiply the modulating sine function.
Could not decide on tremelo or ring modulator so its sort of a highbred...for now, below the 0.5 slider trem amount setting 
its a tremelo, and above 0.5 its a ring modulator.
Theres other sliders for sliding too.
dependances = numpy, sounddevice, tkinter.
